          <p>I am a full stack software engineer who is passionate about debugging code, user experience, and accessibility. My passion for software engineering stems from my teaching background in public education and experience in a technology focused school. I am currently raising a black lab puppy for Guide Dogs for the Blind, where my drive for accessibility comes from. I am currently seeking new opportunities to connect and grow in my career. My experience as a teacher helped me become efficient and adaptable, and fast even in a very stressful environment, which is an important skill in the tech industry.</p>
